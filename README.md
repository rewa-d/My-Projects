# My-Projects

This repository is the contents of various project work and assignments that I have worked on.

## DotNet Technologies

This project consists of the applications that I developed on .NET Framework.

### TaskTrackr

This application demonstrates a typical web application used for task tracking. More details  
can be found in the Readme file in the application directory.

## Game Programming

This project consists of game applications that I have created using Unity Real-time Development Platform.

### 2-D UFO

This game is for demonstrating 2-D game components of Unity. The backend is developed using C# code.
More details can be found in the Readme file in the game directory.

### Roll-a-Ball

This game is for demonstrating 3-D game components of Unity. The backend is developed using C# code.

### Travelopoly - World Explorer

A strategic, educational multiplayer board game inspired by Monopoly, enhanced with AI and Machine Learning for city-based trivia and smart gameplay.

## Machine Learning Project

This project consists of machine learning applications that I have developed using Python, focusing on predictive modeling, classification, and real-time applications.

### Blood Cancer Classification

A machine learning application that classifies blood cell types using image data and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), developed with Python and TensorFlow. It predicts blood cancer cell types such as Basophil, Monocyte, etc.

### Lung Cancer Prediction

A machine learning model that predicts the likelihood of lung cancer using survey data. Built with Python and Scikit-learn, it classifies individuals based on various medical features such as smoking history and chest pain.

## Python

This project contains Python applications that demonstrate Python's capabilities for problem-solving and application development, including utilities and basic programs.

### Python Calculator

A simple calculator application built with Python, providing basic arithmetic functions via a user-friendly command-line interface or graphical user interface (GUI). It demonstrates Pythonâ€™s ability to handle mathematical operations efficiently.
